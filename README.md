## Business Activities 

* **What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?**

    The company is working to address issues related to out-of-date cancer, neurological, and cardiovascular treatments. Large amounts of molecular data are combined with clinical record data to aid in personalized treatment. The company's goal is to help medical practitioners make data-driven decisions about individual patients, hence improving treatment outcomes. 

* **Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**

    The company's target market consists of researchers, large pharmacy companies, and healthcare experts. Oncologists and other medical experts who treat patients with complex illnesses and have access to Tempus' genetic data are particularly targeted. Tempus operates in a global market that is expected to increase from $73 billion in 2022 to more than $150 billion by 2030. Pharmaceutical businesses, medical practices, hospitals, and research organizations make up the market. 

* **What solution does this company offer that their competitors fo not or cannot offer?** ***(what is the unfair advantage they utilize)*** 

    To improve medical outcomes, Tempus distinguishes itself from competitors by combining genetic, clinical, and imaging data into a single AI-powered platform. Modern technology enables physicians to identify therapy gaps and anticipate treatment outcomes. A clinical assistant with AI capabilities is one example of this. Their massive dataset, which includes over 7 million de-identified records, was created to improve patient outcomes using real-world data, distinguishing them from competitors. 

* **Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?** 

    Tempus uses AI algorithms for genetic sequencing, multimodal data integration, and real-time analytics. AI-driven diagnostics and liquid biopsies, which are FDA-approved, are examples of how advances in diagnosis and treatment are made possible by AI tools.

## Landscape 

* **What field is the company in?**

    Tempus is a healthcare technology company that creates and delivers personalized genomic, imaging, and sequence-based solutions to help doctors diagnose and treat patients more quickly by giving information when they need it. For patients suffering from a variety of diseases, including oncology, cardiology, psychiatry, and rare diseases, Tempus' data-driven and machine learning framework allows for academic research and development, clinical trial delivery, and large-scale monitoring of new and innovative medicines. Tempus combines artificial intelligence, genetics, and precision medicine to match patients with the correct medication at the right time.

* **What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5 - 10 years?**

    Important advancements and discoveries in this field throughout the preceding five to ten years:
    
    * **Precision medicine:** This field, which customizes treatments based on a patient's genetic and molecular profile, has grown in popularity. Cancer has been especially affected by this, since genetic sequencing makes more specialized medications possible. 
    
    * **Artificial intelligence and machine learning:** Drug detection, predictive modeling, and diagnostic processes increasingly prominently include AI. Artificial intelligence (AI) makes it possible for technology to sift through massive information and find patterns that human researchers would miss.
    
    * **Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS):** Because NGS technologies are more cost-effective and efficient, they are increasingly being used in clinical settings for genomic testing and patient DNA sequencing for personalized medication.
    
    * **Real-world data and evidence:** supplied by the patient Real-World Data (RWD) is being used more frequently to enhance clinical trial results. This provides useful insights for personalized therapy and improves the accuracy of AI models.
    
    * **Telehealth and remote monitoring:** The healthcare sector has seen a rapid evolution in wearable technologies for telehealth and real-time patient monitoring. The capacity to comprehend data streams from these devices has been greatly impacted by developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
